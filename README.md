What are the personal strategies for surviving and thriving in world ofchange


Framework - Continuous Diagnostic Analysis and Action

If you get the problem wrong generally the action will be wrong

Get on the balcony and observe; understand why things are the way they are; what are the causes of the behavior 

Limited time is generally attributed to a challenge
[My method of diagnosing a problem is to understand the playing field and the players. Understand the playing field by talking to people who somehow influence or get influenced by the playing field. This includes influencers, actors and beneficiaries. This helps me formulate actions which are generally based on short term and long term alignments and/or values.]

We need leadership when we face with challenges

Most people focus on 
Hands (Personal Capacity) - Sow a field with seeds by hand
Tools (authority or influence) - plow

Rather they should focus on Work to be done

Using personal capacities to define leadership is misguided because those same abilities are helpful in many contexts

Skills
Capacity to be trustworthy
To communicate and listen well
How to skillfully use the tools of persuasion, influence, authority and inspiration 

The practice of mobilizing people to meet tough challenges

Work to be done

Identify various types of work to be done

How the types of work relates to practice of leadership

Common reasons for misidentification of type of work

Technical Problems - those which have become a routine now. Example buying a cereal to have breakfast; or show a dentist for root canal etc.. Leadership is not managing and authority
Adaptive Challenges (Innovative challenges / Transformative pressures) - Arise when there is a gap between our current capabilities and desired end result
Pains of Change -> Conserved (+) ; Loss (-) ; New (+)

Leadership - practice of adaptive work
