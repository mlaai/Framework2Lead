# Framework2Lead
This repository is an attempt to define a framework to lead. I wish you join onboard and share your insights in defining this framework.


How to leading in a changing world ? Adaptive pressures will continue to challenge us. How to move ahead on Leadership challenges? How can we use diagnostic method to better understand work and authority. What are the Strategies for taking actions? What are the personal strategies for surviving and thriving in world of change?
The Framework - Continuous Diagnostic Analysis and Action. If you get the problem wrong generally the action will be wrong. Get on the balcony and observe; understand why things are the way they are; what are the causes of the behavior. Limited time is generally attributed to a challenge. My method of diagnosing a problem is to understand the playing field and the players. Understand the playing field by talking to people who somehow influence or get influenced by the playing field. This includes influencers, actors and beneficiaries. This helps me formulate actions which are generally based on short term and long term alignments and/or values. We need leadership when we face with challenges. 

Most people focus on personal capacity and authority or influence. Rather they should focus on Work to be done. If personal capacity is that you need your hands to sow a seed then authority or influence is the tool that plows the fields. 

Using personal capacities to define leadership is misguided because those same abilities are helpful in many contexts

Skills to consider are capacity to be trustworthy, to communicate and listen well and how to skillfully use the tools of persuasion, influence, authority and inspiration. The practice of mobilizing people to meet tough challenges

## Work to be done

Identify various types of work to be done. How the types of work relates to practice of leadership.

What are the Common reasons for misidentification of type of work? TBD

Distinguish between technical problems and adaptive challenges.

Technical Problems - those which have become a routine now. Example buying a cereal to have breakfast; or show a dentist for root canal etc. Leadership is not managing and authority.
Adaptive Challenges (Innovative challenges / Transformative pressures) - Arise when there is a gap between our current capabilities and desired end result
Pains of Change -> Conserved (+) ; Loss (-) ; New (+)

Leadership is practice of adaptive work.
